# Project Intelligence Rules

## Learned Patterns
1. **Simulation Engine**: Use discrete event simulation for ride operations
2. **UI Design**: Prioritize Material-UI for consistent and accessible interfaces
3. **API Development**: Implement RESTful APIs with JSON payloads

## User Preferences
- Developer prefers TypeScript for type safety
- Real-time data visualization is critical
- Scalability must be considered from the start

## Technical Notes
- Use MongoDB for persistence
- Implement caching mechanisms for performance
- Monitor memory usage for in-memory databases

## Known Challenges
- Handling large datasets for park simulations
- Ensuring low-latency communication between services
